- [Space invaders](#space-invaders)
- [Tetris](#tetris)


## Calculator

A calculator app.
But handled some often seen bugs in other calculator apps on the web.
- Typing multiple symbols in a row should not be possible. Fixed that.
- Apps crashing from some often tried cases. Most likely my app won't crash, tested it a lot.

Other features:
- Automatic calculation (No need to press equal to see the result) Pressing any symbol will give you the result and begin new calculation with that result.  
- Simple and minimalistic desing.
- Thats pretty much it.

## Pong
My first game. As with the rest of the games, it was all done with html canvas.

Features: 
- Displays "goals" given for each player.
- Ball speed increases with every hit
- Two player control. 

## Snake
Fun game 

Features:
- Ability to increase/decrease snake speed
- High score
- Thats pretty much it

## Space invaders
This was a bit harded to make than the previous two. But fun.

Features:
- Increasing speed of invaders, player, and bullets as well as rate of fire.
- High score
- Rate of fire for the player is limited, but increases over time. Makes it more challenging.

## Tetris
And this is where i learned what bugs are, and how much they love to eat time.
It's not until later, in other projects that i refined my bug solving technique.

This game was way too complex for me at that time.
I have done most of the things that needed to be done, but very buggy code led me to abandon it and do other projects.

That was the smartest decision i made, because it has sped up my progress a lot, i would have lost even more time there.

I will at some point come back and rewrite this horror.

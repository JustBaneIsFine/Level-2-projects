This txt file is for keeping personal notes, tracking my progress and also instead of 
talking to a duck, i find writing works better for me.. Also forgive the spelling..


I decided to upload these files as well with each app, someone might find it useful or interesting, or funny
to see how i solve some issues..

__CURRENT ISSUE___

What i want to do:
	I want to load 5 pages at a time..
	so for 20 pages that would be 4 cycles..

 	! Now if one page fails to load, i want that page to try again 3 times..

! <- this is where i have an issue...


I am trying to achieve that like this:
loadPage(){
	While(!success){doSomething}
}


If something inside doSomething fails, it will set success to false..
If it succeeds it will set success to true


---------
That is what im trying to do and it sounds pretty simple...

What changes that state of success is an event listener...

So this event listener waits for the page to load up to a certain point,
and then it runs some code to extract the data...
If that event listener fails then it sets success to false...

____THE ISSUE____

That event listener changes the success to false or true,
however javascript has exited the while loop already,
so nothing happens...

It would be great if we could await that event listener
so that javascript doesnt continue to go trough the while function until
we say it should

However i need javascript to continue loading the page...

----What are other ways of doing this?
1. i can load page by page, which will be slower but easier to work with and control

2. i can do it this way, but instead of handling the page reload inside
the function, i can handle it outside by storing the pages that did not return the correct data

I can do it the other two ways, but this current way of doing it seems
like the best way for me
And also it's a challenge to solve..


______Possible solutions______

What if i create another function

A function that will regulate this issue..

async function handler(URL)
	{
		var fail = true;
		var count = 0;
		var data;

		while(fail && count < 5)
			{
				count ++;

				var a = await loadPage(url);

				if (a === promise.failed || a === undefined || a === bad data)
					{
						fail = true;
						data = false;
					}
				else { fail = false; data = a;}
			}
		


			if( data != false){return data;}else{return false;}
	}
